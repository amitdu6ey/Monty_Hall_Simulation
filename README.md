***Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

In above Simulation we exponentially increased the number of trials and then recorded the probablitiy of winning if we switch our first choice of door and as the number of trials increased probablitiy of winning came closer and closer to theoretically calculated value of probability of winning i.e 2/3.
